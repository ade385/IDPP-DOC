    <h1>Privacy Policy for I Don't Plan Planner</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 6, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Company Name/Your Name] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information for the "I Don't Plan Planner" mobile application. Our core philosophy is **Quiet Focus**, meaning we prioritize your privacy and minimize data collection.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Processing Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed around **on-device processing**. Your thoughts, tasks, and personal data (titles, priorities, sketches, photos) are stored locally on your device using **Apple's SwiftData/CoreData**. We do not collect, transmit, or store this sensitive task data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect (Minimalist Approach)</h2>

    <h3>Information Stored Only On Your Device:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Content:</strong> All text input (Brain Dump), task titles, notes, priority levels, due dates, sketches (`sketchData`), and attached photos (`photoData`).</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Tags:</strong> AI-derived context and location tags (e.g., "Walmart," "UPS Store") used solely for task sorting and filtering within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We May Collect (Anonymized Usage):</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party tools (such as Apple's standard reporting tools) to collect limited, anonymized, and aggregated data necessary for app maintenance and improvement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Information about app crashes to fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Usage Statistics:</strong> Aggregate, non-personal data on which core features are used (e.g., how often the Focus View is opened vs. the History View).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location Services (Contextual Task Grouping)</h2>
    <p>The "I Don't Plan Planner" requests access to your device's location to enable **Contextual Task Grouping** and smart sorting. Location services are handled as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"While Using the App" Access:</strong> Your location is used only while the app is active to determine proximity to location-based tasks and prioritize them in the Focus View. This data is processed on-device and is NOT transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>"Always" Access (Optional):</strong> If you grant "Always" access (typically for advanced, proactive reminder features), your location is used in the background to trigger local notifications when you arrive at a task-related location. This data is still processed on-device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share any personal information collected from your use of the app with third parties for marketing or any other commercial purpose. Your task data is your own.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Because your sensitive data (tasks, sketches, photos) is stored solely on your device, it benefits from the security features built into your iOS device (e.g., encryption, device authentication).</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: [Your Support Email Address]</li>
        <li>Website: [Your Website/App Support Link]</li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> This is a template and is not legal advice. You must replace bracketed text (e.g., [Your Company Name]) and consult with a qualified legal professional to ensure this policy accurately reflects your specific data handling practices and complies with all relevant legal requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
